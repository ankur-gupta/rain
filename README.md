**A live example to illustrate python packaging, testing, building, & deploying**

`rain` is an online reference that can be explored by
humans. It provides a living, dynamic alternative to commonly available 
[static documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/). This repository covers 
the following topics.

* file and directory type modules
* selective imports from a directory-type module
* relative imports
* circular imports
* storing and distributing data files
* entry point CLI scripts
* setup logging inside a package 
* storing version information in one location
* specifying dependencies
* running and skipping tests
* obtaining coverage metrics & uploading them to codecov.io
* building and installing this package locally
* example CI/CD using GitHub Actions
* adding badges to your README
* deploying to PyPI (explained but not demo'd)
